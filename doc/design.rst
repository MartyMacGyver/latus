Theory of Operation

Using cloud storage to sync files across computers
--------------------------------------------------

Files are automatically synchronized (synced) across latus folders.  Latus uses existing cloud
storage syncing capabilities (e.g. dropbox, Google Drive, One Drive, etc.) as a file transport.

The additional capabilities are:

- Encryption
- Reduce cloud storage capacity requirements.  Removes files from the cloud once they are synced across
all computers.
